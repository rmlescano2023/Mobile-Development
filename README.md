## LAB 3

In this laboratory exercise, it demonstrates multi-screen navigation using named routes. It is designed to provide a clear and easy-to-understand example of navigating between different screens in a Flutter app.

<br>

Key Features:

Named Routes: The app uses a simple and scalable approach to navigation by defining named routes for different screens.
Screens: The app consists of five screens, each represented by a separate widget. These screens can be navigated to from the home screen:
* Home Screen (HomeScreen)
* Second Screen (SecondScreen)
* Third Screen (ThirdScreen)
* Fourth Screen (FourthScreen)
* Fifth Screen (FifthScreen)

Route Management: The MaterialApp widget manages the routes and provides a clean method to navigate between the screens using Navigator.pushNamed().

## LAB 4

In this laboratory exercise, it shows a simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to manage state using the StatefulWidget. It includes a counter that increments every time the user taps a floating action button.

<br>
 
Key Features:
* State Management: The app showcases basic state management with the help of the setState() method, which updates the UI when the counter is incremented.
* Responsive UI: The app dynamically updates the displayed counter value in the center of the screen.
* Floating Action Button: The user can increment the counter by pressing the floating action button at the bottom of the screen.
* Theming: The app uses a blue theme, with easy customization by changing the primarySwatch in ThemeData.
